# Ft_printf
## Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough
### The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :)

## How to use

clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyven-dr/ft_printf.git
```
compile
```bash
make
```

include `ft_printf.h` to use it

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int  main(void)
{
    ft_printf("Hello world !\n");
    return(0);
}
```

Output should be
```bash
Hello world !
```
